      <h4>Gym-Based Simulator for Energy Systems Modeling And Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Design</h4>
      <p>
        The recent progress in reinforcement learning has made it possible to design controllers to make planning and operational decisions for highly complex power systems. However, it has been a challenging problem to quantify advancements in energy systems study due to the need for a commonly deployed simulation environment. In our research, we have been constructing a set of foundational platforms and computational tools for researchers to directly design and implement their RL and control paradigms on three benchmarking tasks of distribution grid voltage regulation, primary frequency control, and building HVAC system operations.
