        Hi, my name is Chi Zhang. I am an international student from China. I came to the U.S. for high school at La Salle Institute, Troy, NY, because I wanted to discover a different world and look for new challenges. My Bachelor's degree was at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign study in Electrical Engineering. Now, Iâ€™m a second-year Master's student at the University of California San Diego in the track of Intelligent Systems, Robotics & Control. My research interests mainly lie in the intersection between control, ML, and energy systems. 
        Thanks for visiting my website.
