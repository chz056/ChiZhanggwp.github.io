      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Chi Zhang. I am an international student from China. I came to the U.S. for high school at La Salle Institute, Troy, NY, because I wanted to discover a different world and look for new challenges. My Bachelor's degree was at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign study in Electrical Engineering. Now, Iâ€™m a second-year Master's student at the University of California San Diego in the track of Intelligent Systems, Robotics & Control. My research interests mainly lie in the intersection between control, ML, and energy systems. 
        Thanks for visiting my website.

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <h4>Gym-Based Simulator for Energy Systems Modeling And Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Design</h4>
      <p>
        The recent progress in reinforcement learning has made it possible to design controllers to make planning and operational decisions for highly complex power systems. However, it has been a challenging problem to quantify advancements in energy systems study due to the need for a commonly deployed simulation environment. In our research, we have been constructing a set of foundational platforms and computational tools for researchers to directly design and implement their RL and control paradigms on three benchmarking tasks of distribution grid voltage regulation, primary frequency control, and building HVAC system operations.
